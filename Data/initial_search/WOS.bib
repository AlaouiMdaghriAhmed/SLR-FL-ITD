	abstract = {As the cybersecurity landscape becomes increasingly challenging, insider threat detection has emerged as a critical research area. Traditional methods for detecting insider threats, such as Random Forest and Isolation Forest, suffer from high computational resource consumption, poor feature representation, and sensitivity to noise. While machine learning methods offer certain advantages, they still face challenges in complex data scenarios. This study focuses on the application of Federated Learning in insider threat detection. As a distributed machine learning framework, {FL} enables collaborative model building and analysis while safeguarding data privacy. It encompasses various types, including horizontal, vertical, and federated transfer learning. However, its application in insider threat detection remains limited. This research proposes an innovative solution to address the shortcomings of existing Federated Learning-based detection methods (e.g., {FedAT}), such as insufficient feature extraction and high resource consumption. Drawing on the {DeepInsight} concept, we convert different data types into image formats for use with Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNNs}) to train insider threat detection models. This approach leverages the advantages of {FL}’s privacy protection and multi-source data integration while harnessing the powerful feature learning capabilities of {CNNs}. It improves key metrics such as accuracy and recall in insider threat detection. The proposed method offers a more efficient and precise approach to detecting insider threats in cybersecurity, advancing the development and practical application of relevant technologies in this field with significant theoretical and practical implications.},

abstract = {Cloud computing is flourishing at a rapid pace. Significant consequences related to data security appear as a malicious user may get unauthorized access to sensitive data which may be misused, further. This raises an alarm-ringing situation to tackle the crucial issue related to data security and proactive malicious user prediction. This article proposes a Federated learning driven Malicious User Prediction Model for Secure Data Distribution in Cloud Environments (FedMUP). This approach firstly analyzes user behavior to acquire multiple security risk parameters. Afterward, it employs the federated learning-driven malicious user prediction approach to reveal doubtful users, proactively. FedMUP trains the local model on their local dataset and transfers computed values rather than actual raw data to obtain an updated global model based on averaging various local versions. This updated model is shared repeatedly at regular intervals with the user for retraining to acquire a better, and more efficient model capable of predicting malicious users more precisely. Extensive experimental work and comparison of the proposed model with state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed work. Significant improvement is observed in the key performance indicators such as malicious user prediction accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score up to 14.32%, 17.88%, 14.32%, and 18.35%, respectively.}

abstract = {Insider threats have increasingly become a critical issue that modern enterprises and organizations faced. They are mainly initiated by insider attackers, which may cause disastrous impacts. Numerous research studies have been conducted for insider threat detection. However, most of them are limited due to a small number of malicious samples. Moreover, as existing methods often concentrate on feature information or statistical characteristics for anomaly detection, they still lack effective use of comprehensive textual content information contained in logs and thus will affect detection efficiency. We propose LaAeb, a novel unsupervised insider threat detection framework that leverages rich linguistic information in log contents to enable conventional methods, such as an Isolation Forest-based anomaly detection, to better detect insider threats besides using various features and statistical information. To find malicious acts under different scenarios, we consider three patterns of insider threats, including attention, emotion, and behavior anomaly. The attention anomaly detection analyzes textual contents of operation objects (e.g., emails and web pages) in logs to detect threats, where the textual information reflects the areas that employees focus on. When the attention seriously deviates from daily work, an employee may involve malicious acts. The emotion anomaly detection analyzes all dialogs between every two employees’ daily communicated texts and uses the degree of negative to find potential psychological problems. The behavior anomaly detection analyzes the operations of logs to detect threats. It utilizes information acquired from attention and emotion anomalies as ancillary features, integrating them with features and statistics extracted from log operations to create log embeddings. With these log embeddings, LaAeb employs anomaly detection algorithm like Isolation Forest to analyze an employee’s malicious operations, and further detects the employee’s behavior anomaly by considering all employees’ acts in the same department. Finally, LaAeb consolidates detection results of three patterns indicative of insider threats in a comprehensive manner. We implement the prototype of LaAeb and test it on CERT and LANL datasets. Our evaluations demonstrate that compared with state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, LaAeb reduces FPR by 50% to reach 0.05 on CERT dataset under the same AUC (0.93), and gets the best AUC (0.97) with 0.06 higher value on LANL dataset.}
